# Lab 1 - Getting Started
DUE DATE: 4/12/23
## Introduction
In this lab, we set up the Raspberry Pi ubuntu image with the LXDE GUI, got networking working on it, set up the USB 
connection with the ESP32 board. We then got a "hello world" program working on the board and then wrote a program to 
blink an LED on the board once per second.

## Things not working
On the due date, the USB communication with my ESP32 stopped working since I was getting the following error whenever I 
tried flashing my board: `[Errno 25] Inappropriate ioctl for device` but flashing someone else's board worked fine. As a result, I couldn't test all the code on the due date although I had it written. I therefore wasn't comfortable turning it in then. This was the only major issue I ran into.

UPDATE 4-13: I was able to obtain a working ESP32 modu;e and got it to work with a red LED blinking once a second! There are no other issues now.
