# Lab 6 - Morse code translator
## Introduction
In this lab, we connected an LED to the Raspberry Pi over GPIO to output messages in Morse code, and the ESP32 was then programmed to translate this LED Morse code output using a photodiode connected to the on-board ADC (Analog-Digital Convertor) channel. The Python script `send` can be used to output morse code over an LED connected to GPIO 5 on the Raspberry Pi by first running `chmod +x send` and then invoking the script as `./send <# repeats> "<Message>"`.

My implementation remains incredibly accurate when the message is sent at a whopping rate of around **200 characters per second**!!! This is with a `dotDelay` of .0005 (0.5 ms) in the Python script named `send`. To test this, run `./send 1 "$(cat testInput)"` with the photodiode and LED set up *2 cm apart*, and then divide the length of the input file `testInput` (7221) by the time elapsed for sending the message as output by the Python script (around 36.15 sec when I last checked). The file `test-morse-output` contains the translated output from when I last ran this test, which contains only **3 errors**! I used a **300 kOhm resistor** in series with the photodiode in order to obtain accurate readings with a considerable threshold (600 mV) for the analog voltage readings (with the resistor placed _after_ the photodiode and the input for the ADC taken from between the photodiode and the resistor). The LED was placed in series with a **473 Ohm** resistor when connected to the Raspberry Pi 4 on GPIO 5 (with the resistor placed _before_ the LED). I also disabled the IDLE watchdog on the ESP32 by using `idf.py menuconfig` in order to keep panic errors from being raised due to not having enough of a delay in my main loop that allows the IDLE task to run.
